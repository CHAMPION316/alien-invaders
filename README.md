# 2D Shooter [Alien Invaders](https://github.com/CHAMPION316)

Taking inspiration from the classic 1978 [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). This is a 2D shooter created in [python](https://www.python.org/) using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

## 1. Description

The game is a very standard old school style 2D [fixed shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Fixed_shooters) game in which the player uses directional inputs in order to manuever the space ship. 

### 1.1 Objective

The objective is to make it through as many levels as possible without dying. The player will be rewarded **5 lives** at the start of the game. 

- The player allows the enemey to reach the bottom of the screen

### 1.2 Gameplay

Gameplay requires the use of the [**WASD**](readme-files/move-input.jpg) keys to move horizontally and vertically.

**Those lives can be lost if:**

However the player maintains a health bar of 100% and losing all his health bar doesn't account for the lost of lives but instead losing the game entirely. 

In this instance the player loses that 10% health in one of two ways:

- Enemy lasers hits the player
- Player crashes into enemy ship which results in the death of the enemy but not the player

I required a lot of help and guidance for this project due to the fact that I had to take a leave of absense at a job in a cruise ship until just about two weeks ago. There is more I would of liked to have done with this project but unfortunately time was not on my side. I struggled remembering a lot of the information I had learned since there was no way for me to spend the necessary time learning the material. I had to fast track and use a lot of resources to gain some kind of grasp of what I was doing. 

- Background and ships are PNG images designed by me using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

Upon loading the game you will be presented with a very simplistic main menu. You will be instructed to [click](readme-files/start-game.jpg) the mouse button in order to begin playing.

The background is presented with the same image that you see in the main menu of the game which is the background of where the game takes place. I decided to
