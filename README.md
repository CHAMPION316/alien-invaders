# 2D Shooter [Alien Invaders](https://github.com/CHAMPION316)

Taking inspiration from the classic 1978 [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). This is a 2D shooter created in [python](https://www.python.org/) using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

## Description

The game is a very standard old school style 2D game in which the player uses directional inputs in order to manuever the space ship. 

The objective is to make it through as many levels as possible before dying. The player will be rewarded **5 lives**. Those lives can be lost if:

- The player allows the enemey to reach the bottom of the screen

However the player maintains a healthbar of 100% and losing all his healthbar doesn't account for the lost of lives but instead losing the game entirely each. 

`(Working on code to make it account for a reset in health)`

In this instance the player loses that 10% health in one of two ways:

- Enemy lasers hits the player
- Player crashes into enemy ship which results in the death of the enemy but not the player

I required a lot of help and guidance for this project due to the fact that I had to take a leave of absense at a job in a cruise ship until just about two weeks ago. There is more I would of liked to have done with this project but unfortunately time was not on my side. I struggled remembering a lot of the information I had learned since there was no way for me to spend the necessary time learning the material. I had to fast track and use a lot of resources to gain some kind of grasp of what I was doing. 

- Everything is hard coded
- Background and ships are PNG images

By no means is this a perfect game and I had no intensions of making it. My objective was to create a 2D dimensional game that I was able to understand and learn from.

My importance was to understand python as a language and grasp an understanding of it's use in a environment that I enjoy a lot which is gaming.
